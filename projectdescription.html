            At the UVic Health Authority, across multiple home-based care departments, patients and clinicians have both expressed a desire for a medical alert device that, upon a click of a button, opens voice communication between patients and their care team. Those who are still considered in-patients but are receiving care from home can be at risk for unexpected falls or other rapidly developing illnesses that, if become serious, require instant and direct connection to their care team. The faster care providers are able to be notified about their patient’s health status allows more time to respond in an emergency. 

Currently, the solution used at UVic Health Authority is not satisfying the outlined clinical requirements of the device. For patients, the medical alert device worn as a pendant around the neck is too heavy, takes too long to connect to care providers, does not indicate battery life, and although contains an automatic fall detection software, does not detect complex falls (falls that result in a roll, falling onto the device, etc.)

Clinicians responsible for these patients have reported low satisfaction and usability with the current device tracking dashboard. It is unintuitive, does not accurately transpose the device’s location, and device battery life and location history is not reflected accurately or in a timely manner. Additionally, the dashboard cannot be manually prompted for device location and battery life. The device’s lanyard is made of fabric which does not meet Infection and Prevention Control requirements.

UVic Health Authority is looking for a vendor to collaborate with in order to achieve their goals of creating a better user experience using a medical alert device. The device should satisfy patient needs while meeting clinical requirements in order to provide high-quality patient care.
